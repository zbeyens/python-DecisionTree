The credit card information are continuous, so it cannot be used easily for ID3

We first tried to discretise the data using quartiles (having quartiles containing the same amount of data).
We then tried to discretise using standard deviation, which restricted the problematic lines to 4 values (19 positive lines having same values as negative lines)

We have many more negative entries (284315) than positive ones (492). To have values that are better useable for ID3 we used undersampling (selecting 492 random entries from the negative entries).
Without undersampling, we have different values. Try to launch ID3 on both.
